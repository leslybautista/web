    <h1>Asia Overview</h1>
    <p>
      The Democracy Report 2025 highlights a widespread trend of autocratization across Asia, especially in its most populous countries. In East Asia and the Pacific, despite democratic progress in smaller nations like Fiji and Thailand, the region is largely dominated by autocratic regimes—89% of the population lives under autocracy, with only 7% in liberal democracies. South and Central Asia has regressed to democracy levels last seen in 1975, mainly due to India’s democratic decline. Here, 93% of people now live under electoral autocracies, with modest democratic gains seen in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remains the least democratic region globally, with 98% of its population under autocratic rule and only Tunisia showing slight democratic recovery. Overall, autocratization remains the prevailing political trajectory across Asia, with democratic advances limited to a few exceptions.

    <h2>South and Central Asia</h2>
    <p>
      South and Central Asia is undergoing a steep and sustained decline in democracy, with population-weighted scores falling back to levels last seen in 1975. It is now the second most autocratic region in the world, surpassed only by the Middle East and North Africa. This decline is driven primarily by India, home to 1.4 billion people, which was classified as an electoral autocracy in 2019—a status that has remained consistent in V-Dem data since then. Other populous countries contributing to the region's autocratization include Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. As of 2024, six countries—Afghanistan, Bangladesh, India, Kyrgyzstan, Mongolia, and Pakistan—are in the process of autocratization. A staggering 93% of the region’s population lives in electoral autocracies, while another 4% reside in closed autocracies such as Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Only 3% live in electoral democracies like the Maldives, Nepal, and Sri Lanka. Notably, the Maldives and Sri Lanka are the only countries in the region currently undergoing democratic improvement.

    <h2>Kazakhstan</h2>
    <p>
      The most economically advanced country in Central Asia due to its vast oil and gas reserves, has seen limited political liberalization despite its wealth. Under former President Nursultan Nazarbayev, power remained centralized, with restricted political competition and transparency. As economic benefits failed to reach much of the population, public frustration grew, culminating in widespread protests between 2019 and 2022. In response, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev launched a reform initiative in 2022, branded as a "New Kazakhstan," aimed at liberalizing the political system and reducing presidential power. However, critics contend that these reforms were more about easing public unrest than addressing deep-rooted issues like corruption and inequality. While efforts to diversify the economy beyond energy exports show some promise, persistent elite dominance and dependency on oil and gas continue to hinder genuine democratization.

    <h2>Uzbekistan</h2>
    <p>
      Following the death of long-standing authoritarian leader Islam Karimov in 2016, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev initiated significant political and economic reforms. There has been efforts to liberalize the economy, strengthen the rule of law, promote civil society, and improve social protection systems. Initiatives to reduce bureaucratic barriers for foreign investors and enhance governance through anti-corruption measures present potential prospects for democratization.
      Despite these reforms, Uzbekistan's political system remains highly centralized. The ruling party dominates, opposition parties are marginalized, and media freedoms are constrained. While the government's reformist rhetoric signals a departure from past authoritarian practices, substantial challenges persist in establishing a more open and participatory political environment.

    <h2>Turkmenistan</h2>
    <p>
      Turkmenistan continues to exhibit deep-seated authoritarian rule, with limited political pluralism and restricted civil liberties. The government maintains tight control over all aspects of political life, including the media and civil society. Independent political activity is virtually nonexistent, and state propaganda dominates the information landscape. The leadership prioritizes regime stability and loyalty over any form of political liberalization, leaving little room for democratic development.

    <h2>Tajikistan</h2>
    <p>
      Tajikistan operates under a highly authoritarian political environment marked by the systematic suppression of dissent and the marginalization of opposition voices. The government uses legal and extralegal means to silence critics, restrict media freedom, and maintain control over political discourse. Like Turkmenistan, the regime shows little willingness to embrace democratic reforms, instead focusing on consolidating power and minimizing threats to its authority.

    <h2>Pakistan</h2>
    <p>
      In Pakistan, the interplay between civilian governments and the military establishment has complicated democratic consolidation. While elections are held regularly, the military's influence over political affairs has often undermined civilian authority. This dynamic has led to a fragile democratic environment, where elected leaders operate under the shadow of military oversight.

    <h2>India</h2>
    <p>
      India, often celebrated as the world’s largest democracy, is facing growing concerns about the strength and resilience of its democratic institutions. In recent years, the political climate has become increasingly restrictive for dissenting voices. Journalists, activists, and opposition figures have reported heightened government scrutiny, with laws such as sedition and criminal defamation frequently used against critics. Media organizations that challenge official narratives risk pressure through regulatory bodies, funding obstacles, or legal action. These trends have led many observers to argue that democratic checks and balances are weakening, with an executive branch that appears less tolerant of opposition and public criticism. Independent global watchdogs have also noted these patterns, citing a decline in civil liberties and political rights as evidence of democratic backsliding.

    <h2>Southeast Asia</h2>
    <p>
      Southeast Asia features a diverse mix of governance systems shaped by history and ideology. While the post-Cold War "third wave of democratization" brought reforms and stability to countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines, the region now faces democratic backsliding. Oligarchic power, political machines, and military influence—especially in Thailand—have weakened democratic institutions. A legitimacy crisis has emerged, driven by economic struggles, inequality, disinformation, and rising authoritarian influence, eroding trust in liberal democracy and fueling populism. Despite this, think tanks offer a path forward by promoting policy innovation, public debate, and youth engagement, particularly in fragile democracies or authoritarian states. Cambodia illustrates these dynamics, undergoing a managed political transition from Hun Sen to his son Hun Manet. While legitimacy concerns remain, opportunities exist for economic diversification and governance reforms that could support a more meaningful democratic evolution.

    <h2>Indonesia</h2>
    <p>
      Indonesia has experienced notable democratic backsliding since the 2014 election, with key pillars like civil liberties and anti-corruption efforts increasingly weakened. Although the 2024 elections were peaceful and saw high voter turnout, they were marred by allegations of fraud, manipulation, nepotism, and misuse of state resources—raising concerns about public trust in democratic institutions. The election of Prabowo Subianto, a figure with a controversial past and strongman image, is seen as a critical test for Indonesia’s democracy. His ties to the oligarchy and human rights record raise alarms about democratic erosion. Economically, his administration may pursue protectionist and nationalist policies, potentially deterring foreign investment. Balancing these shifts with sustainable development and stable international relations will be essential.

    <h2>Malaysia</h2>
    <p>
      Malaysia is undergoing a period of relative political stability following years of leadership changes, with a unity government formed after the 2022 election. While democracy shows signs of improvement, progress is hindered by the slow pace of institutional reforms. Key initiatives—such as whistleblower protection, a Freedom of Information Act, and the separation of legal powers—have been delayed. The government’s focus on retaining Malay majority support may be sidelining broader reforms, while restrictions on media and ethnic tensions further complicate democratic progress. Nonetheless, this stable period presents an opportunity to implement much-needed structural and governance reforms, especially to attract foreign investment and boost economic competitiveness. Malaysia’s situation underscores the fragile and complex nature of democratization, emphasizing the need for institutional strengthening and inclusive governance.

    <h2>Philippines</h2>
    <p>
      The Philippines has experienced notable shifts in its political economy and democratic governance, moving from liberalism under Aquino III to rising illiberalism under Duterte. Under President Marcos Jr., there is a visible effort to reverse authoritarian trends, with democratic backsliding being actively addressed. However, corruption remains a major challenge, undermining rule of law and hindering development, as reflected in the country's decline in the 2023 Corruption Perceptions Index. Despite these governance issues, the economy has remained resilient, supported by reforms to boost entrepreneurship. Yet, obstacles such as inconsistent policies, complex regulations, and public sector corruption continue to deter foreign investment. For sustainable progress, stronger governance, institutional reforms, and a commitment to democratic principles are essential. Optimism remains for the Philippines' democratic future, with expectations of continued reforms and a more open and competitive market environment.
